A browser userscript (for, i.e., Greasemonkey on Firefox, or Opera) which modifies the times listed on the MLB.tv media center to whatever time zone you want. 

The time zone is controlled by the time_differential variable at the top of the script. Right now, it is set to -3 hours (i.e., Pacific Time,) but it can be changed by simply modifying that variable.

Right now, there is no easy in-browser way to modify the time zones, but if you want to modify the script to have one, just fork me and send a pull request.

You can easily install it by visiting the project's homepage on userscripts.org with Greasmonkey installed, or by simply [downloading the file on Github](https://github.com/int3h/MLB.tv-Time-Zones/raw/master/mlbtv_time_zones.user.js "Download").
